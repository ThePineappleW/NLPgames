# NLP Games

---

A very WIP collection of entertaining programs made using NLP concepts.

## Installation

\*nix:
```
git clone https://github.com/ThePineappleW/NLPgames.git
cd NLPgames
python -m venv <venv-name>
source <venv-name>/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Windows:
```
git clone https://github.com/ThePineappleW/NLPgames.git
cd NLPgames
py -m venv <venv-name>
.\\<venv-name>\\Scripts\\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

See individual READMEs for specific games.
Note that the Windows Python command is `py` (unless it isn't), which will not be reflected in any other READMEs.
